# Vertical-Video-Slider-Comparison-HTML

This project demonstrates an interactive video slider that overlays two videos. 

Users can use a vertical slider to adjust the visibility of each video. 

The implementation ensures smooth transitions and supports both mouse and touch interactions.

__Case of Use__

This project follows the logic of _"before and after"_ photos, but for videos. 

I needed a way to compare two identical videos that have undergone post-processing, such as markerless motion capture. 

One of the many uses of this tool is to showcase VFX breakdowns on VFX studio websites, making the content more interactive.


__Edit__


Just replace `"yourvideofilename1.mp4"` and `"yourvideofilename2.mp4"` with the filenames of the videos you want to compare. 

Be aware that the video files must be in the same folder as the `index.html` file.
